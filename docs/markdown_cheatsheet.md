Markdown (MD) is a lightweight markup language used to format plain text documents. It is commonly used for creating documentation, README files on GitHub, and more. Markdown is easy to learn and provides a simple way to format text without using complex HTML or other markup languages.

Here are some common formatting elements in Markdown:

1. **Headers**:

   Use `#` followed by a space to create headers. The number of `#` symbols indicates the header level (e.g., `#` for heading 1, `##` for heading 2, and so on).

   Example:
   ```
   # Heading 1
   ## Heading 2
   ### Heading 3
   ```

2. **Emphasis**:

   - Use `*` or `_` to create italic text:
     ```
     *italic* or _italic_
     ```

   - Use `**` or `__` to create bold text:
     ```
     **bold** or __bold__
     ```

3. **Lists**:

   - Create an unordered list using `*`, `-`, or `+` followed by a space:
     ```
     * Item 1
     * Item 2
       - Subitem 2.1
     ```

   - Create an ordered list using numbers and a period:
     ```
     1. First item
     2. Second item
     ```

4. **Links**:

   ```
   [Link text](URL)
   ```

   Example:
   ```
   [Google](https://www.google.com)
   ```

5. **Images**:

   ```
   ![Alt text](URL)
   ```

   Example:
   ```
   ![Example Image](https://example.com/image.jpg)
   ```

6. **Blockquotes**:

   Use `>` followed by a space to create blockquotes:

   ```
   > This is a blockquote.
   ```

7. **Code**:

   - Inline code is wrapped in backticks (`):
     ```
     Use `code` here.
     ```

   - Code blocks are created by enclosing the code in triple backticks (```) and specifying the language (optional):
     <pre>
     ```python
     def example_function():
         return "Hello, World!"
     ```
     </pre>

8. **Horizontal Lines**:

   Use three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores on a line to create a horizontal line:

   ```
   ---
   ```

9. **Tables**:

   Markdown supports creating tables using pipes (`|`) to separate columns. You can also use colons to align text within columns.

   Example:
   ```
   | Header 1 | Header 2 |
   | -------- | ------- |
   | Row 1, Col 1 | Row 1, Col 2 |
   | Row 2, Col 1 | Row 2, Col 2 |
   ```

These are some of the basic formatting elements in Markdown. Markdown is versatile, and there are more advanced features you can use for specific needs. Depending on your Markdown processor or platform, there may be additional extensions and features available.
